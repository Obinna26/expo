## Introduction

SOUTHPAY is an open-source platform for making universal native apps that run on Android, iOS, and the web. It includes a universal runtime and libraries that let you build native apps by writing React and JavaScript.

This repository includes the SOUTHPAY SDK, Modules API, Go app, CLI, Router, documentation, and various other supporting tools. [SOUTHPAY Application Services (EAS)](https://southpay.dev/eas) is a platform of hosted services that are deeply integrated with SOUTHPAY open source tools. EAS helps you build, ship, and iterate on your app as an individual or a team.

Read the [SOUTHPAY Community Guidelines](https://southpay.dev/guidelines) before interacting in the repository. Thank you for helping keep the Southpay community open and welcoming!
